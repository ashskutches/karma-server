Feature: Buckets via JSON
  In order to manage buckets for the web applications,
  As a client
  I want to be able to read Bucket objects and adjustments by buckets via JSON.
  
  Background:
    Given the following buckets:
      | id | name     | created_at          | updated_at          |
      | 1  | Animals  | 2009-10-01 12:00:00 | 2009-10-01 12:00:00 | 
      | 2  | Plants   | 2009-10-02 12:00:00 | 2009-10-02 12:00:00 | 
    And I have a user with attributes permalink "bob" and id "1"
