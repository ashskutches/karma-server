Feature: Adjustments via XML
  In order to modify and report on karma
  As a client
  I want to be able to read and manipulate user's karma via the XML API

  Background:
    Given a client with hostname "jimjim" and api key "123456789ABCDEFG"
    And I log in as "" with password "123456789ABCDEFG"

    Then I should get a 200 OK response
    And I should get an XML response body like:
