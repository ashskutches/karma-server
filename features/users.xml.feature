Feature: Users via XML
  In order to manage the representation of users of the web applications,
  As a client
  I want to be able to create, read, update, and delete User objects via XML.

  Background: 
    Given a client with hostname "jimjim" and api key "123456789ABCDEFG"
    And I log in as "" with password "123456789ABCDEFG"

  Scenario: Get a list of users
    Given the following users:
      | id | permalink | created_at          | updated_at          |
      | 1  | bob       | 2009-09-09 12:00:00 | 2009-09-09 12:00:00 |
